NVIDIA DRIVE
============

We provide Docker environments for the NVIDIA DRIVE platform with support from
NVIDIA Corporation. To access any of the following environments, you should have
signed their NDA/SLA to access NVIDIA DevZone and, in some case, should have been
authorized to access internal details of NVIDIA DriveWorks SDK.

DRIVE PX2
---------

If you are using the DRIVE PX2 platform, you can choose Docker with or without NVIDIA
DriveWorks. With NVIDIA DriveWorks, you may leverage NVIDIA self-driving capabilities,
such as line detection and object detection using DriveNet. Without DriveWorks, on the
other hand, all self-driving capabilities are covered by Autoware, thus for example
object detection is based on SSD or YOLO2. For more details, try it our yourself.
